# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One key change I would implement to this project in order to increase overall functionality and traffic to the coffeeshop would be to include the links that direct the customer to the Social media pages for the coffeeshop. This would be beneficial because the social media channels would further boost the credibility and efficacy of the coffeeshop which can lead to more business.
